# Abstract

The proliferation of e-commerce platforms and digital wardrobes has created an unprecedented demand for intelligent fashion recommendation systems that can assist users in creating cohesive, contextually appropriate outfits. Traditional approaches to outfit coordination rely heavily on manual curation by fashion experts or simplistic rule-based systems that fail to capture the nuanced visual compatibility between clothing items. To address these limitations, this project presents an automated computer vision-based system for real-time outfit generation and personalized fashion recommendations, integrating advanced deep learning embeddings with rule-based constraint enforcement.

The proposed system begins by leveraging pre-computed visual embeddings extracted from fashion item images using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks. These embeddings capture high-level visual features including color palettes, patterns, textures, and silhouettes, enabling semantic similarity comparisons between garments. The system architecture follows a client-server model, with a React-based frontend providing an intuitive user interface and a FastAPI backend implementing the core recommendation engine. Users specify their preferences through simple parameters: gender (men/women), season (winter/summer), and occasion (casual/formal), which serve as constraints for the generation process.

The outfit generation algorithm employs a hybrid approach combining embedding-based similarity matching with deterministic rule enforcement. The system first filters the fashion item database based on gender and applies season-specific constraints—for instance, requiring outerwear for winter outfits while restricting coverage types, or excluding blazers for casual occasions. From the filtered candidates, the algorithm selects a "top" garment as an anchor by computing centroid-based similarity within the category, ensuring the chosen item is representative of the available options. Subsequently, the system fills remaining slots (bottom, outerwear) by calculating cosine similarity between candidate items and the growing outfit ensemble, selecting items that maximize visual compatibility. This sequential approach ensures each new addition harmonizes with previously selected pieces, creating cohesive overall combinations.

Beyond initial generation, the system provides interactive customization through an alternative recommendation feature. When users wish to swap a specific item, the system computes a reference vector from the current outfit context and identifies the top-k most similar alternatives from the filtered candidate pool, ranked by compatibility scores. This allows users to explore variations while maintaining outfit coherence. All generated and customized outfits can be saved to a digital closet with custom naming, persisted locally using browser storage for convenient access and outfit management.

To validate the system's performance, the implementation was tested across diverse user scenarios with varying preference combinations. Results demonstrate strong performance in generating visually cohesive outfits that respect contextual constraints, with outfit generation completing in 50-200 milliseconds and alternative recommendations in 30-100 milliseconds, enabling real-time interactive experiences. However, challenges remain in handling edge cases such as limited item availability for specific constraint combinations (e.g., formal summer wear), and the current slot-based architecture excludes footwear and accessories, limiting outfit completeness. Additionally, the reliance on pre-computed embeddings means the system cannot dynamically adapt to new items without reprocessing, and the absence of user preference learning prevents personalization beyond explicit parameter selection.

Despite these limitations, the system offers a practical, scalable, and user-friendly solution for automated outfit coordination, with potential applications in e-commerce product recommendations, personal styling services, and fashion education platforms. The modular architecture facilitates future enhancements, including expansion to additional clothing categories (footwear, accessories, jewelry), integration of style preference learning through user feedback mechanisms, support for additional seasons and occasions, and incorporation of 3D garment visualization. Furthermore, implementing collaborative filtering could leverage community preferences to improve recommendations, while integration with inventory management systems could enable real-time availability checking for retail applications.

This project demonstrates the feasibility of combining computer vision, deep learning embeddings, and rule-based reasoning for intelligent fashion recommendation, paving the way for more sophisticated automated styling solutions. With further refinement and dataset expansion to cover diverse fashion styles, cultural preferences, and body types, such systems could significantly enhance the online shopping experience, reduce decision fatigue, and promote better personal style development. The open architecture and well-documented codebase also provide a foundation for researchers and developers to build upon, advancing the state of the art in fashion technology and recommendation systems.
